My rust solutions to [Advent Of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022/) Problems.

## Disclaimer and purpose

This project is for me to **learn the rust programming language**. I am not aiming to give to the problems optimal solutions,
and it will not be good rust code, altough I try to do my best.

## Contributing

As I wrote, the solutions I am proposing are probably not the optimal ones. If you want to contribute to the *style* of the
code, or want to show me some rust good programming practices that I missed, you are welcome to open a pull request. The only
prerequisite is for the code to be **readable** (don't contribute with super-optimized but unreadable code). If you want to
share your thoughts on possibly better algorithms to be used for a solution, you are welcome to open an issue, and I will happily discuss.
